Playing badminton is my favorite hobby because it keeps me active and energetic.
I may not play like a professional, but I definitely play like I want to win the Olympics.
It’s a great way to stay fit while pretending I am very serious about exercise.

Tracking is a hobby I enjoy because it helps me improve my creativity and patience.
Sometimes I trace so neatly that even the original drawing gets confused about who is better.
It’s relaxing and makes me feel like an artist in training.

Spending time with my pet is the happiest part of my day.
My pet listens to all my problems without judging me and still expects snacks in return.
It’s the purest friendship with unlimited cuteness.

Dancing is my stress-buster and my favorite way to have fun.
I don’t follow steps properly, but my confidence makes up for it.
When music plays, my body dances first and my brain asks questions later.
