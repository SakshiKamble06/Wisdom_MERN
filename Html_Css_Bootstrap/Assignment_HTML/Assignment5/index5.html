    <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
    <h2>Why I Like It</h2>
<p>
    My hobbies include dancing, playing badminton, and spending time with my cat.
    I enjoy dancing because it helps me express myself and stay energetic.
    Playing badminton keeps me physically fit and improves my focus.
    Spending time with my cat helps me relax and brings me happiness.

<h2>How I Spend Time Doing It</h2>
<p>
    I usually practice dancing during my free time or in the evening.
    I play badminton on weekends or whenever I get time with friends.
    I also spend quality time with my cat by playing and caring for it,
    which helps me feel calm and refreshed.

<h4>Daily Routine</h4>
<p>
    My daily routine starts early in the morning when I wake up and get ready for the day.
    After completing my basic activities and having breakfast, I focus on my studies.
    Throughout the day, I manage my time efficiently.
    In the evening, I enjoy dancing, playing badminton, or spending time with my cat.
    At night, I have dinner with my family and prepare for the next day before going to bed.
    This routine helps me stay healthy, disciplined, and positive.
